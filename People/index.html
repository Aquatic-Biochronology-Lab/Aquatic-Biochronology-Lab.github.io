<h2> Principal Investigator </h2><br>
<h2> Assistant Professor Joyce Ong </h2><br>
	<p>I am a fish biologist by training and have completed a PhD on the historical impacts of climate change on fish ecology. I am passionate about the aquatic environment and in particular, about the use of otoliths (fish ear stones) and the information that can be gleaned from such tiny structures, such as the age, annual growth rates, migration and environmental factors. I have also been involved in other aspects of marine and freshwater ecology such as coral reef monitoring, seagrass surveys, turtle research, in-situ coral experiments and biofouling surveys. I am particularly interested in Southeast Asia, not only because I grew up in this region, but also because marine fisheries have major socio-economic impacts on food security and human livelihoods, yet is relatively data deficient.</p>

  <h2> Clement Ng </h2><br>
  <p> I started my Ph.D. in August 2021, having recently completed my Bachelor's Degree at The University of Melbourne in 2020. My Ph.D. project explores the effects of climate change and fishing activity on the growth dynamics of tropical marine fish from the Indo-Pacific region. It is imperative to develop a better knowledge of the mechanism and magnitude by which temperature and harvesting affects fish growth, as they can have broader implications for individual fitness, population dynamics, and stock productivity. Parameterising the natural and anthropogenic stressors of growth expression can help to inform the adaptation of existing fishery management strategies, to ensure the sustainable management and conservation of these valuable fishery resources into the future. </p>
