	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Assistant Professor Joyce Ong's Laboratory Group at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. </em>Our research group is focused on the consequences of human impacts, particularly climate change and fishing, on fish growth in Southeast Asia. </em>Knowledge of how these natural and anthropogenic stressors affect fish growth is crucial, as they can have broader implications for population dynamics and fishery productivity. </em>Examining the information naturally archived in the otoliths (ear bones) of individual fish, we are able to reconstruct the life histories of individual fish, develop climate-growth relationship across broad spatial and temporal scales, and predict potential species' responses and viability to future environmental conditions.</a></p>
