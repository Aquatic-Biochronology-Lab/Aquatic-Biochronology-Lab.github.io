<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>Welcome to Assistant Professor Joyce Ong's Laboratory Group at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Our research group is interested in the impacts of human activity on fish growth in Southeast Asia. Knowledge of how natural and anthropogenic stressors, for example, fishing activity and climate change, affect fish growth is crucial, as they can have broader implications for population dynamics and fishery productivity. By examining the information naturally archived in the otoliths (ear bones) of individual fish, we are able to reconstruct the life histories of individual fish, develop environment-growth relationship across broad spatial and temporal scales, and predict potential species' responses and viability to future environmental conditions.
